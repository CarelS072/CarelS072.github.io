   <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
   <p><em>In the very beginning before I have seen Shereef's video and visited EDC, Auckland, I was a bit skeptical on the program. But having spoken spoken some of its members and viewing Shereef's video I understand that I should not view it as a "course" or "university" but more like an experience towards a foundation to build upon.</em></p>

   <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
   <p><em>Good, I am looking forward on the first day of the bootcamp and what I will learn from it</em></p>

   <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
   <p><em>Take the experience in day-by-day and be respectfull of others</em></p>

   <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
   <p><em>No, my expectations haven't but my impressions have. I like to know how something got to the place/time it currently is, in order to know how it will progress and move on. </em></p>

   <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
   <p><em>Yes, I am very excited and rather then nervous I am anxious. Knowing that this is the first step navigating into a different role and knowing that I am able to stand together with others in a similar goals makes me feel enpowered.</em></p>
