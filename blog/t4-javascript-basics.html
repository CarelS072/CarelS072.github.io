        <p><i>This sprint has been about Javascript and grasping its fundamentals. Following a number of excersizes on <a href"https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript">Free Code Camp</a> it proved a challenging topic and I have more to learn to become a master in it. Even if this might be a bit quirky, this video kept me going (beware: nostalgia incoming) in times of dispair.</i></p>

        <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
        <p>
          Where HTML and CSS more looks at the outside, Javascript tends to be focussed on the automation. If you look at yourself: if you have a style your hair in a particular way, or if you wear a necklace, earrings, or a particular outfit this can be compared with CSS. It is fairly easy to change on the fly. 
        <br>
          HTML is the way that your body is shaped, how fit you are, are you left or right handed. All things that are very important and a tad more difficult to change.
        <br>
         Now Javascript is the automation, your mind. It contains your habits, behaviour and reflexes, but it is not visible from the outside. Even if it is not visible from the outside it can still change how others look at it like a shiny necklace might catch your eye.

        <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h5>
        <p>
          As one wakes up, you will have your own order you tend you start your day. Myself on weekdays I tend to have a shower before I have breakfast and in weekends I tend to be lazy and have it after breakfast (and often after a second cup of coffee too). This is what you can call the controll flow.
          <br>
          During this ritual you might repeat some of the individual tasks like drying yourself off after having a shower. Sometimes you need to perform a few passes before you are dry. Or maybe you choose to clean your ears and keep on using the cotton bud untill it comes out as it went in. This repeating untill it is finished/completed looks very similar to a loop.
        </p> 
         <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h5>
        <p>
          The easiest way to explain the difference is to compare it to rooms in a hotel vs an appartment building. The rooms of a hotel can be of the same size, have the same amount of toilets, bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchen, etc (not all of hotels do, but some have). When you arrive at an appartment building, often you will be presented with a switchboard containing the doorbells for all its tenants, with a nametag corresponding with the appartment number. But if you go to a hotel, the only way to differentiate the room is by its roomnumber.

        <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
        <p>Functions is that automation which can planned for on-demand use. In the automation you can describe what is going to happen like a script for an actor. </p>
