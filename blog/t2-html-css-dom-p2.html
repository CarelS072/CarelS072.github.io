        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
            <p>
            Grid based design is best compared with a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>. Before you start the game each player will need put their fleet somewhere on the playground which is the "grid" of the game and by using the references on the sides of the grid you can pinpoint the location (note: in the game these refrences are static, in CSS, they can be flexible).
            In CSS the grid allows you to start preparing where on the "playground" (webpage), you want your "fleet" (elements/boxes) to be set.

        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
            <p>
            The hype around responsive webdesign comes from everyone currently using different ways of viewing the same content. However these different ways can mean that they are not using a standard computer but a device with a smaller screen like a smartphone or a tablet. Making your website responsive means that the content of that website will adjust itself depending on what is being used to view this content. <em>If you are going are going away for a weekend, a backpack will most likely suffice, however if you are going away for a month, you will need something larger like a suitcase. You will change how you choose to pack and what to bring based on the location and time you will spend.</em>

        <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
            <p>
            In this case the semantic structure helps you to determine what tags you can assign to content it is trying to show of as. IE the most important line or the subject of the page will benefit by being tagged as "h1" where titles of paragraphs could be "h2" or "h3" depending on what other content is on that page.

            Another way of the definition of the Semantic Structure I found which explains it very well is:
            <div style="margin-left:25px; padding: 10px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px"><p>
                <strong>Defining Semantic Markup</strong>

                <em>With those two practices in mind, we can define semantic markup in this way: Semantic markup is the use of a markup language such as HTML to convey information about the meaning of each element in a document through proper selection of markup elements, and to maintain complete separation between the markup and the visual presentation of the elements contained in the document.

        <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
            <p>
            Although in this day of age where there is almost a standard for charging smart phones, there is a standard for HTML and how it should be interpreted by browsers. However this standard is being interpreted differently by different browsers and there are ways which can help in resolving most of these differences ensuring your website is being presented as best as it can be.
