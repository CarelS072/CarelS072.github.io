                <h4>HTML</h4>
                <p>
                    A very simple explanation on what HTML CSS and the DOM are is this:
                    Imagine you are writing an essay on a specific topic, generally you will follow a guideline somewhere which might include a(n) :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover</li>
                        <li>Index</li>
                        <li>Foreword</li>
                        <li>Images/Graphs</li>
                        <li>Summary</li>
                        <li>Glossary</li>                  
                    </ul>
                    If you would put it together any other way your work would probably be frowend upon and if you might miss one or two of these items it might not be looked at it at all.
                    HTML of web page contains all the information and the content, but if being put incorrectly it will not reach its audience.
                </p>
                <h4>CSS</h4>
                <p><a href="https://maggiemcneill.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/paint-by-numbers/">Do you remember paint by numbers? </a> Now imagine writing that essay from before but witout any colours or ink for the text or pieces of paper to write it on... CSS can take care of all the colours, fonts, change how bold the titles can be, the colour of the paper, if you want to read from left to right or right to left, etc. As long if you have the content/information, CSS can perform the changes in terms on how it looks.
                </p>
                <h4>DOM</h4>
                <p>Well the DOM is an interesting one, in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">the Matrix</a> one of the Oracle's students is "bending" a spoon using only his mind. While Neo is pondering on how this is happening, the student asks him if he wants to try it and mentions: "remember there is no spoon". The spoon represents the website, Neo represents our perseption of the spoon and the student is the DOM. Although the DOM receives the same information it allows the subject to be manipulated as well to any shape or form (and see how it has been put together).
                </p>
                
                <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
                <p>
                Boxifying design is when you imagine a website being split into boxes, it doesn't matter if they are square or rectangular or if there boxes within boxes. These boxes help with creating your layout and determine how you need to divide (div) your code for this page.
                </p>

                <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
                <p>
                    The box model can help you determine how much "space" you will need to reserve for the boxes, example: if you don't want to boxes coming to close together you might want to increase the margin. Or if you want the content closer to the border you want to decrease the Padding. The model itself will show you how much space each of the elements have been assigned to which can help you with creating the layout and design of your page.
