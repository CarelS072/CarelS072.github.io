        <p><i>Chapter 3 is going more in depth into the different forms of mindfullnes and how to apply some of the techniques. Although not written in these words, but it does lay some of the foundation of the goal of the book. All in small steps.
        </i></p>
        <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? </h5>
        <p>
          For both myself and my partner it didn't felt as mindfull as that it was practical. Practical as in, the message was clear and the conversation was functional. 
        </p>
        <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
         <p>Walking meditation is a practise I find intriguing and am keen to try it (may or may it not be in the original form as in     the book), I can see myself using it while swimming or jogging as well.
           <br>
          On that note I do fancy the Mindfull listening practice as well as I am not that much of a talker. But I do feel like that presenting is something I need to become more comfortable with.
