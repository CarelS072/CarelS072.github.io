   <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
   <p><em> I have tried the <a href="http://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a> and I am trialing out <A href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">Moving meditation</A> Now I am not sure how well this fit within this kind of meditation, however I like to clear my mind by performing an 1 hour set on the dj decks, although I am busy and concentrating it helps me focus on this 1 task which does have elements which need to be kept in balance.</em></p>

   <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
   <p><em>I will need to review this once I have allowed the methods to become a part of my habits</em></p>

   <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
   <p><em>So far the pomodoro-technique has worked well, I might want to play around with different boxes </em></p>

   <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
   <p><em> I have downloaded the app <a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation-101/what-is-meditation">Headspace</a> which includes other forms of meditation and suggests to start performing this from short sessions to build it up.</em></p>
