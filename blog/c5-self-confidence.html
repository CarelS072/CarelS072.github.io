        <p><i>This post is about chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself and reflecting upon it</i></p>
        <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
          <p>
            Mindfulness and self awareness are very similar. Where being self aware is being aware of the moment, being mindfull is to be aware of the moment in a particular way. Like being tidy vs being organised.
          </p>
          
        <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
          <p>
            I tried the body scan, but I am not feeling how well it will work. I do think this is a practise that needs to be performed multiple times at different times throughout your day (after work, when you wake up, after having dinner, etc). I think different states of your body will give you different outcomes of the scan. One time only gives me a snapshot of what my body is currently is experiencing making it "normal".
            <br>
            On the journaling part I have 1 habit I tend to do at least once a year: I write a letter (a note in Evernote) to myself with what has happened the past few weeks/months. This can be major events or small ones, but tend to be memorable. Once I have finished the letter I add a reminder to look at it in a year to date. When it is the next year, I find it nice to read what my thoughts were and if I have progressed from my situation since. Although I often find it memorable it can also help as a slap in the face to do something if it has not progressed since....
          </p>
        <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
          <p>
            Emotions can be tamed, but I am not sure how I feel about / can rationalise  that. I understand that your emotions do not depict who you are but are a part of your being and that you can choose to show, comfort or suppress them. Does this mean that controlling ones emotion does not have any impact on your self awareness? I assume that the mind still needs to process this emotion one way or another (maybe through journaling?).
