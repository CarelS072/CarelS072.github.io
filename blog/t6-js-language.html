          I was asked to "buy butter. See if they have eggs. If they do, buy 10"<strong> I returned with 10 packs of butter because they had eggs.</strong> 
        </p>

          <i>In this post I will go deeper into some of the interpunction that is used in JavaScript (JS) and what they get used for. </i></p>
      

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>parentheses</th>
              <th>()</th>
              <th>Function - Whatever you put into the parentheses can be used as a placeholder to pass along into that piece of automation. Example: I can tell you to go to the supermarket and get a bottle of milk and some eggs. Or I can write these down on a piece of paper and give it to you to bring to the supermarket.
              <br>
              Loop - within the parentheses you will describe what the conditions for that loop will be in order for it to work. Example: When making instant noodles. You already have put the dried noodles in a bowl and you will need to boil the water first before you add water to it. If you do not do this, the instant noodles will not be instant.
              <br>
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>brackets</th>
              <th>[]</th>
              <th>This is to highlight a collection of data (array). Think of it like a notebook in which you can write something down on page 1, 2, 3, etc. That pagenumber can then be used as a reference to the information it contains</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>braces</th>
              <th>{}</th>
              <th>Within the braces you will add piece of automation (code) to which will be "run" when it is called upon</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>single quotes</th>
              <th>''</th>
              <th>Single quotes can be used if you want to describe something in a literal sense if it is something not natural in the code. When typing the code, often you will use something which already exists within the programming language. However when this doesn't exist quotes (or double quotes) can be used. Often this will be used for names or spaces if there are multiple words involved but they are a part of 1 being. When using Single quotes, it will have an opening and a closing single quote and cannot be interchanged with double quotes. IE you cannot close a single quote with a double quote.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>double quotes</th>
              <th>""</th>
              <th>Double quotes can be used if you want to describe something in a literal sense if it is something not natural in the code.

            <tr>
                <th>Semicolon</th>
                <th>;</th>
                <th>Semicolon used to be required to show the code that you have reached the end of some code, like a period at the end of a sentence. However as it is not required sometimes you do need to add it to highlight the end of a piece of code: <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-automatic-semicolon-insertion/">Examples here</a>  </th>
              </tr>
            
            <!-- <tr>
              <th>parentheses ()</th>
              <th>e.g. '1. Execute a function var result = doSomething()'</th
            </tr> -->
