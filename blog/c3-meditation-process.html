                <p><i>There is a time and a place for everything, just like baking a cake (product) where we are following a recipe       book to make a copy of the one depicted in the photograph.
                  <br>
                      However for the baker, it is the joy of the baking that inspires them most.</i>

          Process over product, the "better" you become at something the more likely tend to forget how important the road having you let to that point is. Having worked in IT for 10 years and having seen "The Web" grow to what it is now, it is easy to mix up old knowledge with the new (HTML, xHTML, iFrame, Frontpage (don't look that up), Flash (neither) ) and it is interesting to see how some technologies were seen as gimmicks (Javascript) and have outgrown themself to something bigger and almost independant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The context behind process over product is one which I do not want to forget, it alone has reminded me to not focus on the ultimate website, but to let it progress in steps and take the information in like a tree going from season to season it doesn't rush.

        <h5>Search Inside Yourself, a reflection, chapter 2</h5>
        <p>
          Before I had read this chapter, I thought about meditation on being good for your mind without any scientific explanation. Like when your parents tell you to do something when you were a child and as you grow older you see why they pushed you to doing it. However having read it is quite the eye opener and it is interesting to read into.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the new things I have learned backing up the reasons why it meditation is usefull. You learn to keep an attention span and to keep it in line as you want. The way this is achieved is the same as training for a marathon (or any other muscle group) and it happens in small doses. Also meditation helps you to be more aware of the small things we take for granted of our minds, the small things we tend let happen by going into auto-pilot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the meditation techniques described in chapter 2 are still in the begining stages and describe the traditional techniques more commonly shown in films and tv. Where this technique is called the seven-point meditation program and in essence require you to be in an non-slanted posture where your body is able to do all the work it needs to do (pump blood, breath normally) and prevents you from doing much else. More advanced techniques will be described in chapter 3 which will be discussed in a later post.
