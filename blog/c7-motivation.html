        <p><i>Reflections of chapter 6 -  Search Inside Yourself</i></p>
        <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
        <p>At the moment of writing:
          <br>
          <strong>Pleasure</strong> is medium - with the recent freed up time I am now doing some things I have left for a while like getting my motorbike license, on which I just got 1 part sorted of.
          <br>
          <strong>Passion</strong> - The passion is getting fed. Learning some new skills which I can hone into "building" skills is something I am looking forward to. 
          <br>
          <strong>Purpose</strong> - Not there, I am not doing what I am doing to change the world. I will be helpfull towards my surroundings and clean up where I can. However the scale will only be the edges of what currently comes to mind untill the next phase has been reached. Once I unlock the potential of the new learnings, it will be great to see how far away it is from creating the next Iron Man HUD, Google Glass, VR/AR experiences, etc.
        </p>
        <h5>What are your core values?, What do you stand for?</h5>
        <p>
            <Strong>My core values are:</Strong>
            Being helpfull
            Being open
            Being honest
            Respectfull
          </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>I stand for:</Strong>
          Equality
          Sharing knowledge
          Freedom
          Personal reponsibility
        </p>
        <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
        
        <p>
          I find the ideas behind creating a resiliance (especially against bad biases) very logical and I can see how the meditation excercises can help against them/understanding and tuning them down.
