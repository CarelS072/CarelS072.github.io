        <h5>Blocked on a simple problem</h5>
          <p>
            <br><strong>What was the problem?: </strong>My trusty scooter was not starting no matter the amount of times I tried to kickstart it or tried using the electric starter. 
            <br><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?: </strong>I did not knew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">the rubber ducky method</a> at the time but it comes close to, I went through the basics of the combustion engine to troubleshoot what was needed to have a proper ignition.
            <br><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?: </strong> Stressed out as the possible outcomes became more and more narrower and I started counting the repair bill in my mind
            <br><strong>What did you learn?: </strong> I generally thing of the worst case scenarios which could occur which does not always have to be the case and to not always put your faith in technology. I was out petrol even though the gauge was saying otherwise. 
          </p>
        <h5>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
          <p>
            <br><strong>What was the problem?: </strong> I had to install a band expander onto my car's radio. As my car was imported from Japan its radio was not capable of receiving local NZ radio stations.
            <br><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?: </strong> Asking a "peer" on what the common way was to keep the built in stereo, but still being able to listen to my favourite radio stations. My "peer" advised me to use a band expander. <br> During installation I found out that the previous owner of the car did some work on the cabling of the radio which allowed me to install the band expander without cutting any existing wires hence I was able to resolve this problem elegantly.
            <br><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?: </strong> I felt quite confident during the process however using an additional piece of equipment to achieve what I wanted felt a bit "wastefull".
            <br><strong>What did you learn?: </strong>Not everything is always as you expect it to be. When moving countries for example, processes might be performed in a different fashion or order then that you are used to. 
          </p>
        <h5>Reflections on problem solving techniques</h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Pseudocode: </strong>Love it. I have used this method in other forms as well, it works well with giving you at least an understanding of what you need/want. 

            <br><strong>Trying something: </strong>I am fond on using this method as long as I know it will not break anything permanent.

            <br><strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>Although I haven't used it as frequent, it is something I believe will help me as a part of the overall troubleshooting process.

            <br><strong>Reading error messages: </strong> Error messages can work very well alongside some documentation or Google. However if you do not have any of that information at hand, it is not usefull. By creating more errors you sometimes can find out what is going on however it is not a route I can recommend.

            <br><strong>Console.logging: </strong>I have never used it untill I started programming and I have to say it is one of my preferred methods as it can give you a quick impression of what you have. With the pseudocode next to it you can make an educated decision where it might be going wrong and work your way through from there. 

            <br><strong>Googling: </strong>This is a basic skill everyone should know or put effort in to learn. It can take some time to filter through the results if your search phrase is too generic. 

            <br><strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong> I have not used this as much as the other methods, however I am sure that once I am in the same room this will change. 

            <br><strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong> What is the difference from peers?

            <br><strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong> This I often find difficult to do as it is easy to fall back in existing habits. Generally it takes about a month to create a habit and often I don't come across the same problem more then a handfull of times per month.
