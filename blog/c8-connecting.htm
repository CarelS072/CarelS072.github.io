        <h6 style="text-align: right">10 October 2018</h6>
        <p><i>This post will go in depth of chapter 7 of Search Inside Yourself and some of the techniques described in this chapter.</i></p>
        <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
        <p>
          No, I haven't had any conversations of that nature.
        </p>

        <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
        <p>
          I feel like that I might be still a bit off, I haven't done any pre-meditated listening only on the fly without proper feedback.  
        </p>

        <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
        <p>
          I found the meditation interesting, however I could not think of many people I really disagreed much with. However for the few whom I could think off I feel more of a status quo rather than a grudge.
        </p>

        <h5>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to move out of my parents house as I wanted to be independend and be able to have visitors around without being/having to keep in mind with my parents (or their visitors) in the house. 
          <br>
          My parents felt that I was better of not going out of the house as it would increase my living costs and will mean I have to put more time into caring for myself. They were also afraid of falling out out of touch
          <br>
          Ultimately it came down to a compromise where I will move out of the house but still visit at least once a week.
