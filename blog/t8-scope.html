        <p><i>What is 'scope', and how does it work in JavaScript is today's topic.</i></p>
      
        <p>You probably have seen those scenes in an action film, where a sniper has their target in their sight and on the screen is being shown what the sniper is able to see thourgh their scope. This vision is what the scope defines: everything that can be seen through that scope is a part of the scope. From the technical sense it will be the case that when a detail has been defined in a part of the code, these details can be viewed by the scope of that piece of code. To be more exact you can have a detail like a variable which can be seen by all the code throughout the code (inception..) however you can have other details that only be accessed by some parts of this code.
        <br>
        Another popular scenario is the highly secure facility where you can only access certain areas once you have a high level access card. Some cards will give you access to all the areas and therefor you will have a <strong> global scope </strong>and some cards will only provide access to specific facilities with only a <strong>local scope</strong> .
        </p>

        <p>
          Where the type of detail will define how widespread the scope is, it is also a complex topic where you need to watch out that some of these details will not get mixed up with one another. This is where Functional programming come in place where these "details" can be more generic and past along from code to code with a lesser likely hood of being mixed up.
