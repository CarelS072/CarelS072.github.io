        <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
        <p>
          My triggers are mostly around when I believe I understand a topic however my code is not functioning as expected. This is where the pomodoro technique helps me to put the time into stopping and breathing. The break often helps me to start noticing why it didn't work. In reflection, often it is a bracket on the wrong place or a typo.

        <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)? </h5>
      
        <p>
          It helps in some situations especially the more heavily emotional ones, which I do not believe I have come across them with programming. Some of my bigger demons I have been able to process with this technique, combine that with time and not feeding the monsters it generally helps.
