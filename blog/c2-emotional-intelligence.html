        <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932">Search inside yourself</a></h2>
            <p>
              Search inside yourself is about how mindfulness can help you be a better you in and outside the workplace. This book assists with explaining some of the techniques you can do to perform mindfullness but also the process behind these actions.

        <h2>Learnings from chapter 1</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence help people being better leaders and can help us find happiness/be in a better state of being.

              Emotional and intellectual competencies go hand in hand when it comes to how "well" someone is performing, some of these competencies are:
              <ul>
                <li>Strong achievement drive and high achievement standard</li>
                <li>Ability to influence</li>
                <li>Conceptual thinking</li>
                <li>Analytical ability</li>
                <li>Initiave in taking on challenges</li>
                <li>Self confidence</li>
              </ul>
              I can see where some of these competencies can help you become more a better leader and or a happier you. Where being more self confident being the important one, however these do need to be given attention equally.
            </p>

            <p>
              To be able to be more self aware and see yourself from a third perspective requires a high attention span that can be trained. Once this has been completed we can start training on "reading" our body better and how emotions are being processed (generally we feel emotions through the body rather then thinking about it. Think of when you are nervous/anxious for a particular event, a gut- feeling).
            </p>

        <h2> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
            <p>
              I have to be honest, I didn't feel much? it might be the case I need to work a lot more on the attention span which I am doing by using "Headspace". What is interesting that there are so many things that try and grab your attention in daily life.
